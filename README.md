# MDN
MDN (Mozilla Development Network) guides those interested in learning web development through a set of articles and exercises. This repository serves to help me keep track of my progress as I learn new technologies through the MDN Web Docs and complete various accompanying exercises and projects.


The modules of articles and complementary exercises and assessments can be found [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn).
